# small_scripts_for_job
This is a still-growing collection of small scripts I use in my everyday job at Head Office of Geodesy and Cartography. 
Acknowledging that in this kind of work we are required to perform a lot of repetitive tasks that could be quite easily automated I started to do so.
While learning to develop more complex projects I used my skills in Python programming to automate some of the processes in Head Office of Geodesy and Cartography
in which I'm involved in.
